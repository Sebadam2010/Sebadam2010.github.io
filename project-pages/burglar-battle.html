          <div class="body-text">This game was created with the Unity game engine inside of a 5 month span with the entire class of university students (~40 people) for the "Commercial Games Development" module as part of the UWE Games Technology course. 
            Groups were split up into teams of around 7 people with each team focusing on different aspects of the game. This project used agile methodology.
            <br><br>Apart from completing miscellaneous tasks such as placing environments and lighting in certain prefabricated rooms and fixing bugs, I mainly worked on various gameplay elements such as creating, implementing and upkeeping interactables such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Simon says puzzle </li>
              <li>"ButtonFrenzy" game, player needs to move around in the room, pressing buttons
            within a certain time period</li>
            <li>Whack-A-Mole style game, player has to interact with the button that is lit up inside a certain period of time, within a grid of buttons.</li>
            <li>"Loot wheel", a wheel of fortune style interactable where the player can press a button to start spinning the wheel and then obtain a random item based on where the wheel finishes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br> Various other interactables and gameplay features that I had created but were not added to the game can be found in my development diary here: <a href="../assets/PDFs/SebastianAdamatzky_DevDiary_NoStudentNumber.pdf">PDF</a>
